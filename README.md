3. Data Collection Methodology. State how the data is collected, by whom, how often, etc. 
The datas are from Metro Bike Share. The Metro Bike Share is available for download on Google Play and App Store. Metro and its partners at Bicycle Transit Systems are pleased to share anonymized Metro Bike Share trip data with the public. 

Metro Bike Share is a transportation service that offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips and to get to and from transit on costmer’s schedule.Their intent behind collecting this data is to monitor the usage of the Bike Share program, improve its services, and share anonymized data with the public to encourage transparency and foster a data-driven approach to transportation services.

I downloaded the each .csv file contains data for one quarter of the year. Then I combine them. Trips below 1 minute are removed.

It's fall, a season with favorable weather for outdoor activities, riding a bike can be a picturesque and pleasant experience. Understanding the bike-sharing data can provide insights into popular routes, times, and patterns that can optimize my bike-riding experience with my friend.
